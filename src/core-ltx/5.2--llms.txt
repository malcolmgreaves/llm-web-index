# FastHTML (fastht.ml)

> FastHTML is a Python library for building modern web applications in pure
> Python, emphasizing solid web foundations (HTTP/HTML/CSS/JS) and
> hypermedia-style interactivity (often via HTMX) rather than heavy JS
> frameworks. This site is the product homepage and includes an intro video,
> interactive component demos, a tech stack overview, sample projects, FAQs, and
> links to documentation and community resources.

The homepage itself is implemented as a FastHTML app and demonstrates:

 - **Isolated components** with scoped CSS/JS (e.g., a 3D hover card).
 - **Dynamic server-generated HTML** (e.g., real-time weather table).
 - **Reusable UI components** (e.g., an accordion).
 - **Database-backed rendering** via an object `__ft__` render method (example
   uses `fastlite`).

Structured elements present on the page:

 - Primary navigation: logo link to home, and a prominent **Docs** link.
 - Hero section: positioning statement + CTAs (**Learn more**, **Watch intro**).
 - Interactive tabbed demo section: “Components”, “Dynamic”, “Reusable”,
   “Databases”.
 - “Get started in minutes” feature cards: speed, flexibility, scale.
 - Tech stack section linking to deeper “about” pages for foundations and
   technology choices.
 - Samples section linking to a GitHub examples repository and specific example
   folders.
 - FAQ accordion section answering common product questions (deployment,
   relation to FastAPI, SPA support, JS usage, performance).
 - Testimonials carousel including one link to an external tweet.
 - Footer links to GitHub, Discord, Docs, and site design credit.

Outbound links include third-party hosting/deploy platforms, GitHub
repositories, Discord invite, YouTube embed, and attribution sources. The page
also loads external JS/CSS libraries via CDNs (jsDelivr, cdnjs) and embeds
images hosted on ucarecdn.

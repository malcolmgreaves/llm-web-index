# Sherwin-Williams Global Gateway

> A concise, expert-level summary of the Sherwin-Williams gateway site. It
> provides an at-a-glance description of the site’s purpose, its key
> navigational sections, and outbound links useful for quickly locating external
> resources and third-party tools referenced by the site.

This document presents a structured overview of the site’s main content, its
navigational elements, and curated outbound links. It is intended to help an LLM
quickly understand what the site covers, how content is organized, and where to
fetch additional information beyond the site’s own pages. It focuses on concise
descriptions and externally hosted resources that may be relevant for
integration tasks, documentation lookups, or API references, while noting that
much of the site’s content is accessible through its internal navigation and
region-aware sections.

 - The website acts as a centralized gateway for Sherwin-Williams content,
   including paint colors, color tools, inspiration, professional resources,
   region selection, and store locators. It also provides access points for
   homeowners, professionals, and industry partners, plus sections for Get
   Inspired, News, Careers, and Sustainability. The navigation includes
   categories such as Shop Products & Color, Rooms, Exterior, Stain, Color
   Tools, Get Inspired, Architects, Homeowner Paints, Stains & Supplies,
   Resources, and Our Company.
 - The site includes regional selection, a store locator, and a Sign In option,
   along with a region modal to switch locales. It also loads a variety of
   third-party scripts and trackers to support analytics, personalization, and
   social features (e.g., Ensighten, Google Tag Manager, Adobe Tag Manager,
   Gigya). The content is delivered via a mix of HTML, Experience Fragments, and
   dynamic components (carousels, linklists, and megamenus) designed for
   large-scale product and content navigation.
 - Outbound resources are interspersed throughout the page (scripts and external
   content providers) and include third-party services used for analytics,
   marketing, and social integration, as well as external content sources such
   as sample providers and partner sites. The site also points to external
   content for color inspiration, product demonstrations, and partner
   information.

Notes

 - The site includes numerous internal Sherwin-Williams pages (e.g.,
   sherwin-williams.com, industrial.sherwin-williams.com) that expand on product
   families, color tools, and industry-specific coatings. For outbound
   navigation or data gathering, focus on the external domains listed above and
   any external media or partner sites that are linked from the gateway.
 - The links listed here reflect outbound resources that are visibly referenced
   by the HTML source (scripts, third-party providers, and external content
   sources). The site’s internal navigation remains the primary path to content
   such as color families, color collections, rooms, exterior colors, stain
   colors, and professional tools.

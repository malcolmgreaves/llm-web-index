> Sherwin‑Williams global gateway: marketing and commerce home for color, paint
> products, tools, inspiration and B2B groups (Homeowners, Painting Contractors

> Visualizer, Color Expert, Paint Calculator), collections (ColorMix, Top 50,
> Color ID), project resources (how‑to videos, FAQs), PRO+ business tools, and
> industrial subdomains (industrial.sherwin‑williams.com). It also embeds
> analytics/third‑party scripts and a large image carousel, top‑colors carousel
> and multiple teaser/link grids. Use this llms.txt to find canonical site entry
> points and the most relevant internal and external resources to fetch
> LLM‑friendly content.

This file describes the page structure and provides curated lists of important
URLs grouped by purpose. Sections marked "Optional" point to resources you can
skip for a smaller context (images, CDNs, analytics). Use the "Primary" and
"Color & Tools" groups first when you need compact, high‑value context for
color/product queries; use "Industrial" and "Professional" for specification and
product data.

# FastHTML

> FastHTML — a library and demo site for building modern web applications in
> pure Python. The homepage is a live FastHTML app that demonstrates:
> interactive Python-defined UI components (scoped CSS/JS), dynamic
> server-side-rendered snippets, reusable components (accordion, 3D card),
> database example, sample applications (Game of Life, TODO, chatbot,
> Pictionary), FAQ, testimonials, and links to docs, source code, and deployment
> guides. The page includes embedded demos, code snippets, and third‑party
> assets (YouTube, highlight.js, CDNs).

This llms.txt summarizes the page structure and the important URLs. Use it to
help an LLM quickly understand what the site provides and where to find detailed
resources.

High-level page structure and interpretation notes:

 - Hero: headline "Modern web applications in pure Python", short pitch, CTA to
   docs and "Learn more" (about).
 - Interactive demos section: four live demo tabs (Components, Dynamic,
   Reusable, Databases). Each tab shows a Python code snippet and a rendered UI
   preview (3D card, weather table, accordion, DB-generated todo list).
 - Samples: links to example repositories demonstrating small, self-contained
   FastHTML apps (Game of life, To‑do, Chat bot, Pictionary AI).
 - Tech stack / Stacked cards: shows foundations (ASGI, HTMX, HTTP, HTML),
   familiar tools (Python, Uvicorn, Starlette, SQLite) and deploy targets
   (Railway, Vercel, Hugging Face, PythonAnywhere).
 - FAQ: common questions and answers about use cases, deployment, relation to
   FastAPI, HTMX, JS usage, and performance.
 - Testimonials: quoted endorsements and a carousel.
 - Footer: copyright, links to main repo, Discord, docs, and site designer.
 - Client-side assets: multiple CDN scripts (surreal, css-scope-inline,
   highlight.js, highlightjs-line-numbers), local JS helpers (carousel,
   highlight, code copy), and embedded YouTube video used for "Watch intro".
 - How to use this file: internal pages and canonical URLs are listed below
   under “Primary pages”. External resources, example repos, community links and
   third‑party CDNs are grouped into focused lists to help LLMs fetch
   authoritative context.
